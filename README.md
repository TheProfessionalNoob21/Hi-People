# Hi-People
This is my first Repository. It's supposed to be a hello world, but I thought that Hi-People sounded better.

I am The Professional Noob. I like Minecraft(who doesn't) and Clash Royale. I am a Pokemnaiac and am learning basic Python. I plan to make a game and post the code in the repositery here.
I think this is enough for the 'hello-world' thing.
